    Hi, my name is Karam Mardini. I graduated from the American International School of Egypt West campus, and I am currently studying design and media (digital media) at the knowledge hub  Universities, Coventry University. I participated in many different events, internships, and activities. But I am mainly a photographer/videographer with skills in photo shoot composition and editing. Consistently meeting artistic goals and project specifications. I am an energetic videographer accustomed to working with clients to achieve desired looks for range of personal and business needs. In addition, I worked with many artists, for example, Khaled mounib, Wael Jassar, Amir Karara, Khaled mounib, Hamaki, and many more. I also worked as my school's photographer/videographer for 4+ years. in addition, being responsible, productive, creative, and always ready to learn are the most important aspects not in college but in life generally.
